# Unscramble Computer Science Problems Using Python

In this project, I set out to complete five tasks based on a fictional set of calls and texts (stored in a csv) exchanged during September 2016. I used Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Finally, I rounded the analysis off by documenting run time (Worst-Case Big-0 Notation) analyses of my solution and determine each algorithms' efficiency.

## Task 0 

This task revolved around finding the first record of texts and last record of calls.
Simply, the solution to this task revolved around a simple search for the elements with a collection of lists (csv file). 
Hence, the run time analysis of this algorithm was O(1).
